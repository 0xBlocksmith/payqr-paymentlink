 * Central thirdweb setup.
 *
 * The merchant's on-chain identity is a thirdweb SMART ACCOUNT (ERC-4337),
 * created from an in-app wallet (phone/social login). Gas is SPONSORED by the
 * thirdweb paymaster (sponsorGas: true), so the merchant transacts with 0 ETH —
 * same zero-ETH UX as before.
 *
 * REQUIRED env: NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID
 *   Get it from thirdweb.com/dashboard → your project → Settings → Client ID.
 *   It is public (safe to ship to the browser), but LOCK IT DOWN in the
 *   dashboard: restrict it to your production domain(s) so nobody else can use
 *   your sponsorship quota.
