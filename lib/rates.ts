/**
 * USDC→local-currency rate for the app's fiat estimates (Accept, Withdraw,
 * Dashboard, Transactions, Wallet).
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the p2p.me protocol itself — never an external FX API.
 * The Accept-page checkout and the fiat withdrawal both price against the
 * Diamond's on-chain `buyPrice`, so every fiat figure the merchant sees MUST
 * come from that same number. Mixing in a market rate (e.g. CoinGecko) made the
 * estimate and the actual charge disagree (₹500 est vs ₹499 charged; far worse
 * for BRL where the on-chain price is a testnet placeholder), which just
 * confuses the merchant. On testnet the on-chain rate may be "wrong"
 * economically — that's fine and intentional: showing the SAME wrong rate
 * everywhere is consistent; showing two different rates is not.
 *
 * Sources, in order:
 *   1. On-chain `getPriceConfig(currency).buyPrice` — the exact rate the
 *      checkout charges / withdrawal settles at. Primary for every currency.
 *   2. p2p.me subgraph — the average rate recent COMPLETED orders settled at
 *      (fiatAmount / usdcAmount). Still a p2p rate; used only if (1) is missing.
 *   3. A static per-currency fallback, so the UI never shows a broken rate.
