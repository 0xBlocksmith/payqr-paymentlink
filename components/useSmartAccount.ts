/**
 * The merchant's identity is their thirdweb SMART ACCOUNT (ERC-4337), created
 * from an in-app wallet (email/social) with gas SPONSORED by the thirdweb
 * paymaster — so the merchant transacts with 0 ETH.
 *
 * Returns (SAME shape the app already consumes):
 *   address          smart-account address (the on-chain merchant identity)
 *   ready            true once a smart account is connected and usable
 *   sendTransaction  ({ to, data, value? }) => `0x${hash}` — a sponsored tx
 *
 * `useActiveAccount()` returns the SMART account (not the underlying admin EOA)
 * because the wallet configured in providers.tsx wraps the in-app wallet in a
 * smartAccount({ sponsorGas: true }). So `account.address` IS the smart-account
 * address that gets registered on-chain.
